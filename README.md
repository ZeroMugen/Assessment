How to run: 
Used notepad++ and Python, as it is the most simple for me. Download file, open with notepad++ and run. If not running, assure that python in downloaded (using latest download), check that language in reading in python. Check if plug-in NPPExec is installed; navigate to Plugins Admin and search if not. Once installed click for Execute NPPExec Script and add the C:\python.exe pathing on your pc to be pasted just before the  "$(FILE_NAME)" text. C:\Users\{user name}\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\python.exe "$(FILE_NAME)" Should look like this then save. Afterwards  just click on Macro on the tool bar and run python. 

 

Process:
Made two different varibles with the same array for acension and decension and declared the functions for output. To avoid using builtin functions, utilized while loop. While loop reads the numbers in the num_list array. The way the computer reads the program is that it will start with the first number in the array and compare it with the next and will check which number is less than the other. If the number compared is less it will be replaced with the lesser number with the append call. And then number would be remove from the num_list to avoid duplication. then repeats until there is nothing to compare. while loop for the decension order. Process is the same as above except the direction is reversed. Ends by outputing the order arranged after the while loop
